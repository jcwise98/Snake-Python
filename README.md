# Snake-Python
I've done some things in python my first semester in college, but never any projects. I wanted to make a
simple game to gain some decent exposure to the language.
There are some random python modules that I made and played around with to relearn the language a bit.

Experimentation modules:\
hello_world.py - this is the main file I mess around in\
square.py - a small module I made that contains one function. I used this to experiment with imports


Snake Project modules:\
none so far :crying:

How my Snake game works:\
ehhh...it doesnt
